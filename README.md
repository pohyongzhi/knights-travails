# Knight Moves Algorithm

This algorithm calculates the shortest path a knight can take on a chessboard from a starting coordinate to an ending coordinate.

## Function

The function `knightMoves(startCoords, endCoords)` uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path. It prints the number of moves and the path taken.

## Usage

Call the function with starting and ending coordinates as follows:

```javascript
knightMoves([0, 0], [3, 3]);
```
